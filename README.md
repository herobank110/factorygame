# FactoryGame

Python game to create an automated factory production line.

## Overview

### Design

Factorygame is a game engine meant for simple, minimalist games. It supports
a large array of graphical features such as shapes, colors and lines. The
framework is developed with the idea to enable rapid game development and
prototyping, with a robust and extendable toolset.

### Flexibility

The use of the Python scripting language throughout makes this engine highly
flexible. It has an open source policy to support understanding and extending
any part of the engine with ease. By letting users choose their workflow, it
empowers them to use their existing techniques to speed up build times.

### Development Operations

This game engine can cater to many experience levels. Python is already
vastly popular and the number of users is growing. Nothing in the framework
is preventing users from building a game as it's designed to be a streamlined
hassle-free time. Previous users of Godot's scripting language will feel at
home.

## Installation

Just download it and start working straight away. It is recommended to have
some Python knowledge, although this is optional. First take a look at the
included samples by executing `run_test.py`. This will showcase all the current
included features.

## Usage

You are free to use this engine as you wish. We would love to know if you have
made a game with it.
